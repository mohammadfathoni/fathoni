13. Collection of device information.
-------------------
  The SOFTWARE may enable Brother to collect information from any consumables, and/or other electronic devices connected to the Brother products ("Devices"), including, but not limited to, the printer model, serial number, and location of your Devices ("Device Information"). Additionally, information on your use of products (printing date, number of printed pages, the types and sizes of paper, ink consumption, etc.) and information of the operation of those products (such as error logs) may be sent to Brother's server. Any information on your use of products and the operation of those products accumulated prior to the installation of the SOFTWARE may also be sent to Brother's server. Such information (except for the serial number) does not identify you as a person nor will be associated with any of your personal information. Brother will use such information solely for the purpose of statistical analysis and improvement of our service.

  Device Information includes the serial number of our product. If you register information through to our sales company's product registration website, such sales company will hold information which may personally identify you and the product's serial number. However, Brother will not personally identify you because Brother will not be provided such information. The serial number will be maintained in strict accordance with Brother's "Statement on Device Data " which is available at Brother's Website <http://www.brother.com/privacy/device/index.htm >.

  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Brother or Brother’s affiliates may ask for your consent to use Device Information for various direct marketing purposes in the course of providing our products or services (“Direct Marketing").  Such request to use the Device Information for Direct Marketing purposes shall be made clearly and separately from this EULA.  It shall not be construed in any way that you are obliged to consent to the processing of Device Information for Direct Marketing purposes. Brother shall use or provide to its affiliates the Device Information for Direct Marketing purposes only with your consent, and you will not be deemed to have consented to such purposes solely by agreeing to this EULA.

  You may opt out of the collection of device information in this section of the EULA by changing the settings of the installer or this SOFTWARE.
  If you have previously installed any software or application for the Brother Machine (for the purposes of this paragraph, Brother Machine shall be limited to Brother’s printers and multifunctional products only), installing this SOFTWARE may overwrite the features used for collecting Device Information under such previous software or application.  In such case, the terms and conditions of Section 13 of this EULA shall apply to your Device Information collected and processed under such previous software or application.


Additional Terms and Conditions

1. For accessing Brother Websites after installation of the SOFTWARE, you further agree to the following:

Once you install the SOFTWARE, the SOFTWARE may automatically display a website operated by Brother or its sales subsidiary in the region where you reside (“Brother’s Regional Website”).  In addition, a shortcut icon or menu that links to Brother Creative Center, a website that provides free, professionally designed business and home printable projects, will be created on your desktop or on application(s) (hereinafter, Brother’s Regional Website and Brother Creative Center are collectively called “Brother Websites”).
These Brother Websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC (“Google”), to track and monitor how you use the website.  Google Analytics uses cookies to distinguish unique users by assigning a randomly generated number as client identifier and uses this information to monitor your behavior on websites.

The shortcut URL to Brother Websites contains a parameter that includes information such as the model name and serial number of your product, and the country and language information of your computer (the “Parameter”).  When you access Brother’s Regional Website via the website that is automatically displayed after installing the SOFTWARE, or when you access Brother Creative Center via the shortcut, and from there onwards, the information in the Parameter is associated with the random client identifier assigned by Google, which enables Brother to combine your product information with information such as your browsing behavior on Brother Websites, including, but not limited to, which web pages you have visited, how long you stayed on the website, and how you got to the website.

If you visit other Brother-owned websites including, but not limited to, Brother support website, your browsing behavior on such websites may be further associated with the client identifier and combined with the information in the Parameter.

If you would like to know more about the purposes for which the information collected through Brother’s Regional Website is used and the ways in which the information is protected, please refer to the respective privacy policy of the Brother sales subsidiary of your country or region.  For Brother Creative Center, please refer to the Terms of Use for Brother Creative Center <https://www.creativecenter.brother/en-us/terms-of-use>.  The serial number in the Parameter can be associated with the data which you might register through our sales subsidiary’s product registration website.  However, the serial number will not be used to identify you or for purposes other than what is set forth above. 

If you would like to prevent your data from being collected and processed by Google Analytics, you can opt-out from Google Analytics by downloading and installing the Google Analytics’ Opt-out Add-on <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>.

2.For Brother hardware products that include functions which convert scanned data into Microsoft Office file, you further agree to the following:

2.1. You need Internet access in order to convert scanned data into Microsoft Office file ("the Service"). 
2.2. When converting your data, the scanned data is temporarily stored in servers of third parties, which are provided under a contract with Brother. Such data shall be used only for the purpose of (i) providing the Service, and (ii) analyzing the performance and functionality of the Service (anonymous data only). 
2.3. The Service may be suspended or discontinued without notice due to changes in circumstances of server providers or other reasons.





PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION RELATING TO FIREWALL / ANTIVIRUS.

In order for all the network features on your Brother product(s) to work, some of the Windows Firewall port settings need to be changed to enable network connection and continue with the installation.
